this DOES NOT have a license (The current license is fully permissive),
BUT this site is MODS of NON OPENSOURCE GAME(Survivalcraft),
THIS SITE WILL BE SHARED CAREFULLY TO THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE THE GAME,
AND WE HOPE THAT NO ONE USE IT TO PIRATE THE GAME,
If the creator of the game(Marcin Igor Kalicinski, i.e kaalus) 
And if he wants this site down, unfortunately IT WILL BE DOWN
Why don't we ask him for permission? because he doesn't answer
